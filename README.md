# RickAndMortyApp

* Master branch includes the last safety version.
* Dev branch include savedStateHandle that secures the app state to be persisted without minding the android memory management when the app is on background. Also tested and secure, but I will let it be in two branches.


## This app has been developed with the following techniques:
- Jetpack Compose
- Clean Architecture
- MVVM
- UseCase pattern
- Coroutines & Thread optimization
- StateFlows
- API response handling
- Uncaught logic errors handled
- Error handling
- App State persistence after android kills the process (just home screen to prove I know how it works)
- Horizontal view mode
- Testing: principal viewModel and useCases, which includes combined flows tested and principal user iteractions
- SOLID friendly
